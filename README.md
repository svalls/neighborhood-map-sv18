# Neighborhood Map Project
by Sofia Valls

## About
This is the last project required for the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.

This single page app features a map of Santa Barbara, California and it shows places that I would like to visit someday.
It uses Google Maps API (map), jQuery (AJAX request), Knockout framework (list and filter) and
Foursquare API (get data for each location).

## How to run the app
1. Download the zip file and open index.html on any web browser
2. Click on the markers to get more information about the places
3. Type a keyword on the input text area to filter locations 
4. The app is fully responsive so it will work on any device
